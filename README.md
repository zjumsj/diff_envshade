# diff_envshade: Differentiable Shader for Environment Lighting in PyTorch

`diff_envshade` is a **differentiable, CUDA-accelerated PyTorch extension** for shading 3D models under **environment map lighting**.

- **Input:** per-pixel surface attributes (e.g., normals, BRDF material parameters) and an environment map (lat-long rectangular format)  
- **Output:** per-pixel RGB colors  

Shading is computed via brute-force integration: each texel in the environment map is treated as a directional light, and contributions are accumulated according to the BRDF. This simple yet effective approach ensures fully differentiable gradients, is well-suited for non-highly-specular materials (e.g., human faces), and a 16Ã—32 environment map resolution provides a good balance between performance and quality.

This shader can even account for omnidirectional visibility, taking occlusions from all lighting directions in the environment map into consideration. The occlusions themselves can be efficiently computed using [`torchoptixext_visibility`](https://github.com/zjumsj/torchoptixext_visibility). With visibility considered, shading 70k 3D Gaussians can still be completed **within 1 ms** (tested on an RTX 4090).

## Installation
